This project is Kru Hao (or Hao Hoa's) private study tool for getting better with his pinyin and pronunciation. It aims to
* highlight lots of gotchas,
* give an easy way to listen to pinyin patterns (especially endings/vowels),
* easily search MDBG for example words

Kru Hao also shares it with friends and the broader community. 

you can find his email in the bottom of the webpage, somewhat obfuscated with a gmail icon.
